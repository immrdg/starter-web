There is no programming language–no matter how structured–that will prevent programmers from making bad programs. (Larry Flon) Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right. If everything did, you’d be out of a job. (Mosher’s Law of Software Engineering) If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger W. Dijkstra) The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense. (E.W. Dijkstra)
