The bulk of all patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid. It’s up to the patent owner to do so, and to enforce them. (Linus Torvalds) The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense. (E.W. Dijkstra) Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life. (Michael Sinz) A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any invention in human history–with the possible exceptions of handguns and tequila. (Mitch Radcliffe) Windows NT addresses 2 Gigabytes of RAM, which is more than any application will ever need. (Microsoft, on the development of Windows NT, 1992).

I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn’t show up in a Unix directory listing. (Oktal) The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim. (Edsger W. Dijkstra) There are only two industries that refer to their customers as ‘users’. (Edward Tufte) A hacker on a roll may be able to produce–in a period of a few months–something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) would have a hard time getting together over a year. IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers, or more. (Peter Seebach)
